            So as you can obviously see here, the happiest country is Finland.
            Almost all these countries are European countries with the exception
            of Israel and New Zealand. Best tip is to just go study Finnish and move to Finland.
            Now you might wonder why all these countries have such high happiness scores. What 
            makes a country happier? This is exactly what we will be looking at in the next part.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Here are 4 different factors that affect the Happiness of a country.
            For both GDP per capita and Healthy Life Expectancy, we can see that
            it has a postive relationship with the happiness score. As one increases
            the other also increases. You can also see that there is an even distrubtion
            of GDP per capita and Healthy Life Expectancy. Theres countries with higher 
            and countries with lower GDP per capita and Healthy Life Expectancy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            However for the graph showing the countries' freedom you can see that a 
            majority of the points are on the right side of the graph this means that
            majority of countries give their people freedom to do whatever they want.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            You could have probably guessed this. When the people of a country view 
            their country as corrupt, they will definetly not feel very happy and will
            decrease their happiness score. You can also see that a majority of the points
            on the graph are on the right hand side which suggests that the people of most
            countries view their country as corrupt            
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            A bonus factor. As you can see there is barely any correlation between the generosity
            of a country in relation to their happiness score. I didn't even know you can receive
            a negative generosity score. With a majority of the data points of the left hand side,
            we can conclude that most countries are <del>heartless</del> not very nice. On the next
            page we will be comparing the data of certain countries, so be sure to continue reading.
