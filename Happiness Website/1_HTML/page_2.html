            Now we are taking a look at Singapore's happiness compared to its
            neighbouring countries. The other countries aren't even close at all.
            I think it will be pretty interesting to compare the individual factors
            between these countries. At the end we will be looking at the ranks of
            these countries throughout the years from 2013 to now. To see the increase
            and decrease in ranks.

        <p>
            I obviously could have put them all into one graph, but
            this probably looks better and will be easier to understand.
            You can't really tell the difference between these, except for
            the Corruption graph, where the people of the other countries
            clearly view their country as way more corrupt. A small shock is
            how Japan and South Korea is lacking behind in the freedom department
            compared to the other countries.
